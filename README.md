##Project Overview
Sarcasm detection is a challenging task in natural language processing. This project aims to build a machine-learning model that can identify sarcasm in news headlines. 

#Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the sarcasm detection model is crucial to the success of the project. In this repository, you will find a folder named data containing the dataset files. The data includes labeled examples of both sarcastic and non-sarcastic news headlines. It is curated and preprocessed to ensure its quality and reliability.

#Model Building
The core of this project is the development of a machine-learning model for sarcasm detection. The model is built using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques and trained on the provided dataset. The model directory contains all the code and resources related to model architecture, training, and evaluation.
